        <h1>Experiment setup</h1>

        <p>
            The sector combustor rig consists of $20^\circ$ sector of to-the-scale gas turbine combustor. The
            experiments
            consists of high inlet mass flow rate of air ($m_{total}$) ranging from 0.1 kg/s to 0.5 kg/s. The inlet
            pressures ($P_{in}$) are also changed from 0 bar gauge to 4 bar gauge. All these experiments are done under
            cold flow conditions. No fuel is supplied to the system in the experiments.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main experiments consists of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), wherein the flow inside the primary and
            exit zone of the combustor is visualized using high-speed lasers and cameras. Simultaneous acquisition of
            dynamic pressure sensors (i.e. pressure fluctuations) are also captured.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data for any experiments consists of 3 major things.
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="#PIV_data_handling">PIV flow field data</a> : - Consists of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ velocity
                vectors in 2-D grid. The files are in .vc7 format. <mark class="code_mark">ddr_davis_data</mark> is used
                to handle this data.
                <ul>
                    <li>Average data</li>
                    <li>Instantaneous data</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <a href="#dynamic_PT_data_handling">Dynamic pressure sensor data</a> :- Consists of voltage reading for
                multiple PT. <mark class="code_mark">lvm_reader</mark> is used to handle this data. The code just reads
                the data from
                file and converts it into numpy array for further processing. </li>
            <li><a href="#DAQ_data_handling">Combustor controll system data</a> :- Consists of data from multiple static
                p[ressure transducers attached
                on the combustor and inlet mass flow rate ($m_{total}$) data. This data is stored in .pickle file during
                the run of the experiment.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </section>


    <section id="PIV_data_handling" class="section">
        <h1> PIV data handling </h1>

        <p>
            The data organization is done in multiple steps. Every succesfull run is stored in the excel file. Each run
            is characterized by its unique $m_{total}$ and $P_{in}$. But to consider for multiple runs, trial number is
            provided to each run. Hence, for R-theta plane PIV the cases of $m_{total}$ and $P_{in}$ are same, but trial
            number is different. This information is stored in excel file. This excel file then contains the folder path
            of the davis-set of the respective experiment.
        </p>

        <p> Similarly, the control parameters of respective runs are also stored in the same excel file. Now, the excel
            file also consists of some meta parameters like coordinates of swirler edge, the coordinate of swirler
            center etc. This is also to be updated for every run. Usually this remains the same for same calibration
            set.
        </p>

            <div class="fig_caption">Raw images of PIV data</div>
        </div>

        <p>
            So, below are the steps for data segregation for PIV experiment. Although, this steps are sometimes followed
            for other experiments.
        </p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h1> Mark of datumn points </h1>

            <p>
                Any experiment performed will be done to obtain imformation at any particular location of the
                experimental setup. Like PIV is performed at particular plane located at predefined location, this
                location needs identification in the image so as to convert the recorded images into the world
                coordinate system. To do this, either we can place some identification and then take the image. Or-else,
                we can keep some mark which will be present in all the recorded images.
            </p>

            <p>
                First step is to identify the coordinate or pixcel location of these marks. Below figure shows the marks
                done on the raw image to identify the location of swirler. Here, two important parameters were to be
                identified. 1) Identify the angle of the swirler and 2) Identify the center of the swirler. By marking
                multiple points on the line shown by red dots, identifies the swirler angle. And by marking the midpoint
                of orange points shown in the figure, we get the center of the swirler shown as black dot we identify
                the center or (zero, zero) coordinate.
            </p>

            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/streamwize_plane_marked.jpeg">
                <div class="fig_caption">Marked Datumn points</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Now, this arrangement of datumns can be different for different experiments. Hence this has to be chosen
                wisely. For, R-theta plane experiment, this choise of datumn changes. In R-theta plane, only one datumn
                is required because , we just need the center of the swirler. During multiple experiments, we
                specifically know the location of R-theta plane, hence only the center is to be identified to mark the
                plane exactly in the world coordinate system. Below figure shows the marking of 3 points on the swirler
                (orage color) which can uniquely identify the center of the circle (circumcenter, marked as black).
            </p>

            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/r_theta_plane_marked.jpeg">
                <div class="fig_caption">Marked Datumn points on R-theta plane</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h1>Adding path to PIV experiment data folder</h1>
            <p>
                Add paths of experiment folders in excel files. This file will then be read from the python and each
                experimental case can be accessed from python. Using excel and python, we just have to input the
                experiment parameters. The python will then search for respective files and folders using data in excel
                and returns the data. This helps in longer run, as we tend to forget the path and folder locations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h1>Saving the data to local folder</h1>
            <p>
                Keeping the hard disk attached to the PC for longer time is avoided here. Hence, the data from hard-disk
                is copied into the local folder in the form of <mark class="code_mark">numpy</mark> array. The data is
                saves as-it-is. No prerocessing is performed on the data before saving.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="dynamic_PT_data_handling">
        <h1>Dynamic PT data handling</h1>
        <p>
            Dynamic PT data is recorded simultaneously with PIV at multiple locations of the combustor. This helps in
            understanding flow-acoustics interactions. During PIV experiment, the NI-DAQ is triggered from laser and
            dynamic PT data is acquired and saved automatically. But PIV images needs the confirmation of user to save.
            So, sometimes if PIV images are not proper then re-run is done. During this re-run, dynamic PT data is again
            saved. Hence while comparing the PIV data with any dynamic PT file, care has to be taken if there is any
            mis-match of acquisition time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the correct file of the run is identified, then it is stored in separate location with trial number
            appended to its file name. Python code searches the file having particular trial number. The files of all
            the run done in the experiments are stored in single folder with unique names for ease of searching.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="DAQ_data_handling">
        <h1>DAQ data handling</h1>
        <p>
            DAQ data contains the data related to monitoring of the experimental control system. System monitoring is
            started way before the PIV experiments are done. Hence, if we only want the data during the PIV experiment,
            then we first need to crop the data accordingly and save it somewhere else. The files of all the run done in
            the experiments are stored in single folder with unique names for ease of searching.
